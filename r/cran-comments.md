## Resubmission

This is the initial submission of vennDiagramLab.

## Test environments

## Downstream dependencies

None — this is a new package.

## Companion packages

`vennDiagramLab` is the R companion to the
[`venn-diagram-lab` Python package](https://pypi.org/project/venn-diagram-lab/)
(v2.0.2 on PyPI) and the [Venn Diagram Lab web
tool](https://www.venndiagramlab.org/). The three implementations share the
same SVG model library and produce byte-equivalent TSV outputs (verified by
12 parity tests against shared golden fixtures).

## Notes for the reviewer

* Five bundled sample datasets in `inst/extdata/samples/` (~250 KB total)
  cover both biological (cancer drivers, MSigDB pathways) and mock
  (streaming platforms, gene sets) scenarios — all used in the eight
  vignettes for fully self-contained execution.
* `inst/extdata/models/` contains 44 SVG model templates + 44 JSON region
  files (~700 KB total) from a dozen published Venn / Edwards / Grünbaum /
  Anderson / Carroll / Mamakani / SUMO construction methods — bundled for
  byte-equivalent rendering parity with the web tool.
