    "- **Jaccard**: how much do two sets overlap relative to everything in either set?\n"
    "- **Dice (Sorensen-Dice)**: same signal, but weighted toward moderate overlap.\n"
    "- **Overlap coefficient**: is one set almost completely contained in the other?\n"
    "- **Fold enrichment**: how many times greater is the observed overlap than chance?\n"
    "- **Hypergeometric p-value**: is the overlap statistically significant?\n"
    "- **BH-FDR adjusted p**: can we trust that significance after testing 6 pairs at once?\n\n"
